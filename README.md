Design pattern is basically of three types.

`Creational Design Patterns`
`Structural Design Patterns`
`Behavior Design Patterns`

So basically we will be talking about **builder design pattern which is one of the Creational Design Patterns**.

### Builder design pattern.

**Builder design pattern is used to create complex object**.

>>>
The builder pattern allows you to enforce a step-by-step process to construct a complex object as a finished product. In this pattern, the step-by-step construction process remains same but the finished products can have different representations.
>>>
**An example of builder design pattern is given below.**
